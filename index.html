        <p>Hi my name's Isaac. I'm a Web Developer, Triathlete, and Extreme Sports enthusiast. I currently am working at eBay as an account manager, I'm working to land a job in Web Development in 2018.</p>
        <p>I've lived in Utah most my life, but spent a few years oustide of Utah. I lived in Southern Oregon (a little town called Klamath Falls) for two years and then spent two years in the country of Kenya on a church service mission, I can speak some Swahili.</p>
        <p>My favorite food is Indian Food, I'm a sucker for Naan bread and some Paneer Masala. I don't cook much at home but if I did I'd learn a few of those recipes!!!</p>
        <p>I envision myself coding for ecommerce websites, online education, and projects that promote growth in third world countries like <a href="https://www.kiva.org/" target="_blank">Kiva</a>. I have a passion for technology and its potential to improve our quality of life. I would love to help growing countries and our country further embrace this technological revolution of which we are a part.</p>
